Moddie – “the fox monster in your backpack” – one day NPC
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moddie is a female fox (aka vixen) , another experiment subject found 
in Irenicus’s dungeon.  She has the (limited) power of speech and some
special abilities, like turning into a werewolf  O.o . She was not
done in one whole day but in a few, and it all took less than 24
hours.

Moddie is found behind the jailkeep golem in the first level of
Irenicus’s dungeon, so you have to start a new game to meet her.

She banters with 12 BioWare’s NPCs (doesn’t banter with Nalia,
Jaheira, Viconia and Imoen) and should have a Tree of Life dialogue.
She talks to the protagonist a little and you can initiate some
“talks” with her, too. Most of them are based on the same technology
as flirts. Moddie cannot interject – and I came up with a reason for
that – she’s a talking vixen, she’d only get you into trouble!

Finally, she uses a wolf animation and was voiced by me. And the bad
accent, incorrect speech (and edited pitchy voice) is *intentional*!
So, this is the unique opportunity to hear me bark, too. >:(
